<br>Hey, This is Anant! <br>

Numbers (usually) make sense and if they don’t make sense there is (usually) a reason why. It’s just a matter of looking in the right place. It was during my internship at Larsen and Toubro where I realized my love for numbers and it moulded my professioanl journey into what it is now. I have completed my bachelor's in civil engineering from National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra and have garnered expereince in the Digital Marketing and Healthcare domain as an analyst.

My thirst to learn more has brought me here at UT where I am currently pursuing my MS in Business Analytics. Here, I am working on subjects like Advanced Machine Learning, Marketing Analytics, Analytics for Unstructured Data etc. Favourite part of studying at UT has been collaborating on projects with people from varied backgrounds as it provides the much needed depth to analyze complexities from a global outlook. Do checkout my academic projects under the portfolio tab.

I am an inherehtly curious person, nothing gives me more joy than learning something new. Whenever presented with an opportunity to work on a completely new project, my reply will be "Yes I will" and the next thing you know I am rushing back to my desk to learn how to even start. I am an avid reader and books/novels have been my companions since my childhood. I also love to cook and I live my life to see people grin ear to ear after eating delicious food. I love to explore new cities and meet new people. You can find me playing some strategy/board/video game in my freetime.

"It takes humility to reconsider out past commitments, doubt to question our present decisions and curiosity to reimagine our future plans."

Big ol' Galactic Hugs :)
