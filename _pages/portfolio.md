**Customer Reviews based Recommender Engine**

User feedback often helps discover knowledge about the product from the perspective of the consumers which can be utilized by sellers to increase sales. Based on customer reviews of jackets in mens category, a specific brand is selected for each user as per the three 'attributes' they care most about. The rec engine formulates the closest match by incorporating both the sentiment score (VADER) as well as cosine similarity scores (from tf-idf vectorizers and spacy embeddings)

**Best Price Guarantee on E-Commerce Platform - NLP and Image analytics**

Millions of products are sold on an e-commerce platform, but how to identify same products being sold by multiple vendors? Identification of same products and offering customers the cheapest possible price would go a long way in improving customer relations. We deal with a dataset which has plethora of classes and limited data points. Deep dived into image and word embeddings using BERT, Word2Vec, EfficientNet algorithms.

**Causal Inference in distilling Halo effects from Brand perceptions**

Explored survey data for 2012 United States presidential election wherein latent variables such as probable predilection towards specific candidate as well as halo effect (tendency for positive impression to spill over into opinions in other areas) posed as key modeling challenges. Structural Equation Models were formulated to statistically prove the impact and directionality of latent driver variables onto brand (candidate) preferences while also quantifying their ‘spillover effect’ into other independent driver variables.
